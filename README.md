## Overview

Aggregate national metrics show data centres consuming less than 1% of total U.S. water, but this masks community-level realities where a single facility's peak-day demand can exceed the entire capacity of its host public water system. The **Water Consumption Impact (WCI)** index resolves this scale mismatch by measuring impact at the utility level, on the worst day.

The WCI quantifies the fraction of a host public water system's peak-day delivery capacity that is permanently consumed by a single data-centre facility's evaporative cooling demand:

```
WCI = C_peak / K = (W / K) x r x PF
```

A three-factor decomposition maps each term to a distinct policy lever:

| Factor | Meaning | Policy Lever | Intervention |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **W/K** | Demand scale | **Siting** | Locate facilities in communities with larger utility capacity |
| **r** | Consumptive ratio | **Technology** | Adopt closed-loop or dry-cooling systems to reduce evaporative loss |
| **PF** | Peak amplification | **Management** | Flatten demand peaks through load shifting and storage |

## Variable Definitions

| Symbol | Definition | Units |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| W | Facility water withdrawal | ML/d |
| K | Host utility permitted delivery capacity | ML/d |
| r | Consumptive ratio (C/W; fraction lost to evaporation) | dimensionless |
| PF | Peaking factor (peak-day / average-day consumption) | dimensionless |
| C_avg | Average-day consumption = r x W | ML/d |
| C_peak | Peak-day consumption = C_avg x PF | ML/d |
| HH_eq | Household equivalents = (C_avg x 365.25) / 0.4146 | households |
| g | Compound annual growth rate | dimensionless |

## Risk Classification

| Tier | WCI Range | Interpretation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **OVERLOAD** | > 100% | Peak-day demand exceeds the entire utility capacity |
| **SEVERE** | 50 -- 100% | More than half of capacity claimed on peak day |
| **HIGH** | 25 -- 50% | Growth headroom eliminated |
| **MODERATE** | 10 -- 25% | Noticeable; demand management warranted |
| **LOW** | 5 -- 10% | Minor contribution; standard planning suffices |
| **MINIMAL** | < 5% | Negligible impact |

## Ten-Site Results

| Rank | Site | State | Operator | WCI (%) | Risk Class | Household Equiv. | Breach Year (13% CAGR) |
|------|------|-------|----------|---------|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Lebanon | IN | Meta | 134.0 | OVERLOAD | 3,261 | Already breached |
| 2 | Council Bluffs | IA | Google | 59.9 | SEVERE | 9,220 | 2029 |
| 3 | Mayes County | OK | Google | 57.0 | SEVERE | 7,610 | 2029 |
| 4 | The Dalles | OR | Google | 48.6 | HIGH | 3,301 | 2030 |
| 5 | Douglas County | GA | Google | 31.4 | HIGH | 3,348 | 2034 |
| 6 | Wisconsin Site | WI | Microsoft | 26.6 | HIGH | 59 | 2035 |
| 7 | Botetourt County | VA | Google | 13.8 | MODERATE | 5,136 | 2041 |
| 8 | Midlothian | TX | Google | 3.5 | MINIMAL | 1,665 | 2052 |
| 9 | Memphis | TN | xAI | 1.3 | MINIMAL | 2,568 | 2060 |
| 10 | Henderson | NV | Google | 0.2 | MINIMAL | 1,893 | Beyond 2074 |

The index spans nearly three orders of magnitude, from 0.2% at a large municipal utility (Henderson, NV; SNWA 900 MGD) to 134% at a small rural system (Lebanon, IN; 4.6 MGD) where peak demand exceeds the entire municipal water supply.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

```
Python >= 3.8
pandas >= 1.3

```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BasitAkin/Water-Consumption-Impact_WCI_Index.git
cd Water-Consumption-Impact_WCI_Index

```

### Run the Full Analysis

```bash
python src/wci_calculator.py

Produces four publication-quality PNG figures (300 DPI) in `results/`.

### Use as a Python Module

```python
from src.wci_calculator import compute_wci, classify_risk, run_all

# Single-site calculation
result = compute_wci(W_ML_d=4.81, r=0.77, K_ML_d=17.41, PF=6.3)
print(f"WCI = {result['WCI']:.2%}")   # WCI = 133.93%
print(classify_risk(result['WCI']))    # OVERLOAD

# Full batch analysis
df = run_all('data/site_inputs.csv')
print(df[['site', 'WCI', 'risk_class', 'HH_equiv']].to_string())
```
